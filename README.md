## Hi there 👋

I’m Logan Cadman, a graduate student in Computer Science at Colorado State University. My journey to computer science has been anything but traditional—I started out as an automotive technician, solving mechanical problems and working with my hands. Along the way, I discovered a love for technology and how it can make a real difference in people’s lives.

At CSU, I’ve grown in ways I never expected. From leading student orientation programs during COVID to working as a Systems Administrator for the Computer Science department, I’ve developed my skills as a leader, problem-solver, and tech enthusiast. My internship at VMware introduced me to the exciting world of cybersecurity and networking, where I learned how technology can tackle big challenges like reducing environmental impact through virtualization.
