## Hi there 👋

I’m Logan Cadman, a graduate student in Computer Science at Colorado State University 🐏💻. My journey to computer science has been anything but traditional—I started out as an automotive technician 🔧, solving mechanical problems and working with my hands. Along the way, I discovered a love for technology and how it can make a real difference in people’s lives 🌍✨.

At CSU, I’ve grown in ways I never expected. From leading student orientation programs during COVID 😷🧑‍🤝‍🧑 to working as a Systems Administrator for the Computer Science department 🖥️🔐, I’ve developed my skills as a leader, problem-solver, and tech enthusiast. My internship at VMware introduced me to the exciting world of cybersecurity and networking 🌐, where I learned how technology can tackle big challenges like reducing environmental impact through virtualization 🌿.
